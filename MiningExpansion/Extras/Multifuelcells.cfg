	@description = Need electricity but don't have the space to radially attach Fuel Cells? The Mk2 Fuel Cell generator offers the same easy power generation that Fuel Cells offer, but in a convenient Mk2 fuselage section.  Like the smaller fuel cells, this generator operates by converting fuel and oxidizer into energy.

This generator offers the same easy power generation that Fuel Cells offer, but in a convenient 2.5 meter housing. Like the smaller fuel cells, this generator operates by converting fuel and oxidizer into energy.
