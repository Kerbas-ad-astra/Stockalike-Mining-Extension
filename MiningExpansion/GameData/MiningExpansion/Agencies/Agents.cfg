  description = With the advent of offworld mining came changes to the mining industry. The CEC is a loose alliance of both established mining firms and tech startups that have banded together to evaluate, exploit, and expand their buisness models to include the newfound mineral wealth of other celestial bodies. To that end CEC has worked to develop tools and equipment to do the job, from small and portable kit suitable for probes to massive extractors and refineries capable of supplying the needs of even the largest of mining bases.
