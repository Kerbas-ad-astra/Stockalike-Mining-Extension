title = Fuel Cell Generator
manufacturer = Coreworks Extractions Consortium
description = Need electricity but don't have the space to radially attach Fuel Cells?   The Fuel Cell generator offers the same easy power generation that Fuel Cells offer, but in a convenient 1.25m meter housing.  Like the smaller fuel cells, this generator operates by converting fuel and oxidizer into energy.
